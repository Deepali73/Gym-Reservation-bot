# Gym-Reservation-bot
This project is a simple Gym Reservation Bot implemented in C++ that allows users to book time slots and gym sections, view existing reservations, and get AI recommendations for the least crowded time slot.
Features

Make Reservations:

Users can choose a time slot and gym section to book.

View Reservations:

Displays all existing reservations with user details.

AI Recommendation:

Recommends the least crowded time slot using a simple AI-based logic.

User-Friendly Interface:

Text-based menu system for easy navigation.

How It Works

Time Slots: Predefined time slots like 6:00 AM - 7:00 AM, 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM, etc.

Gym Sections: Includes "Cardio Zone", "Weightlifting", "Yoga Room", and "Swimming Pool".

AI Logic: Counts reservations in each time slot and recommends the slot with the least bookings.

Code Structure

Reservation Structure:
Stores user name, chosen time slot, and gym section.

Functions:

displayTimeSlots(): Displays available time slots.

displayGymSections(): Displays gym sections.

getUserChoice(): Validates user input.

recommendTimeSlot(): Provides AI-based slot recommendation.

Prerequisites

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).

Basic understanding of terminal/command prompt.

g++ main.cpp -o gym_bot

Run the program:

./gym_bot

Example Usage

Main Menu:

Choose an option to make a reservation, view reservations, get AI recommendations, or exit.

Making a Reservation:

Enter your name, choose a time slot, and select a gym section.

AI Recommendation:

Suggests the least crowded time slot based on existing reservations.

Future Enhancements

Persistence:
Save reservations to a file or database for permanent storage.

Advanced AI:
Use a pre-trained machine learning model for smarter recommendations.

GUI:
Create a graphical interface using Qt or another GUI library.
